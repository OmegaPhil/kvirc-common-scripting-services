Common Scripting Services implements aliases useful for users or scripts - and therefore some of my KVIrc scripts depend on this script.


Installation
============

To load the script into KVIrc (which then persists until you uninstall), in a KVIrc console window:

    /parse <path to script file, speechmark-delimited if the path contains spaces>


Uninstallation
==============

In a KVIrc console window:

    /CommonScriptingServices::uninstall::uninstall


Development
===========

Try out my modification of the [geany](http://www.geany.org/) IDE, extending it to syntax highlight, parse KVIrc Script for aliases, events, variables, shortcut for loading scripts into KVIrc etc: [Github documentation](https://github.com/OmegaPhil/geany-kvircscript/wiki/README---KVIrc-Script-Integration).


Bugs And Feature Requests
=========================

Please create an issue on the Github issue tracker.
